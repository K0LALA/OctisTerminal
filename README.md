# Octis

This game is based on **Tetris** but this time as a 2-player game where the goal is to make the oppponent place a block over the limit.<br>
<br>
This version of the game is written entirely in Python.<br>
`octis.py` is an attempt to make an AI for the make, which is unfinished.<br>
`octis_col.py` is the finished game, with no known bugs.<br>
This same game is also written in [C](https://github.com/K0LALA/OctisC) and has extra features, but no AI.<br>
<br>
You are free to use the entirety of the idea and the code as you wish as this was made for eductional purposes.
